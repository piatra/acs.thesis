We present {\project}  a search application running over streams of Twitter message. As opposed to most services that just do simple text search over conversations {\project}  aims to cluster messages together in order to simplify going through large number of messages involving similar topics. Unlike most software solutions that use a fixed corpus when clustering, {\project}  works with streaming data, Twitter messages are continuously retrieved and the clusters update as more data comes in. We try to combine a variety of methods to improve our clustering estimates such as TF-IDF and part of speech tagging. This paper describes the implementation of the system and explores similar projects that tackle problems similar to ours.
